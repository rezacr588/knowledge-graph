Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data. Deep learning is a specialized technique within machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

Natural language processing (NLP) is another important area of AI that enables computers to understand and generate human language. Modern NLP systems use transformers and attention mechanisms.

Applications of AI include:
- Healthcare: Medical image analysis and disease prediction
- Finance: Fraud detection and algorithmic trading
- Transportation: Self-driving cars and traffic optimization
- Education: Personalized learning systems

The field continues to evolve rapidly with new techniques and applications emerging constantly.
