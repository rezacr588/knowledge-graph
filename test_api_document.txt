Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing technology. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming.

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns. Natural language processing (NLP) allows computers to understand human language.

Key applications include:
- Computer Vision: Image and video analysis
- Speech Recognition: Voice assistants and transcription
- Recommendation Systems: Personalized content
- Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving technology

The future of AI promises even more innovations in healthcare, education, and industry.
