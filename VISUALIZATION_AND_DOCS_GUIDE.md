# Knowledge Graph Visualization & Documentation Guide

## Overview

Two new powerful features have been added to the Hybrid RAG System:

1. **Knowledge Graph Visualization** - Interactive visualization of entities and relationships
2. **Interactive Documentation** - Comprehensive guide explaining how the system works

## New Features

### 1. Knowledge Graph Visualization

#### What It Shows
The Graph tab provides an interactive visualization of your knowledge graph, displaying:

- **Entities**: Extracted named entities (people, organizations, locations, concepts, etc.)
- **Relationships**: Connections between entities
- **Statistics**: Real-time counts of documents, chunks, entities, and relationships
- **Node Details**: Click any entity to view detailed information

#### Color Coding
Entities are color-coded by type:
- **Blue** - PERSON
- **Purple** - ORGANIZATION  
- **Green** - LOCATION
- **Orange** - CONCEPT
- **Pink** - PRODUCT
- **Red** - EVENT
- **Indigo** - DATE

#### How to Use
1. **Navigate** to the "Graph" tab
2. **View Statistics** in the cards at the top (documents, chunks, entities, relationships)
3. **Explore the Graph** - entities are displayed in a circular layout
4. **Click Nodes** to see detailed information about any entity
5. **Hover** over nodes to highlight them
6. **Refresh** to reload the latest graph data

#### Technical Details
- Canvas-based rendering for smooth performance
- Displays up to 50 entities by default (configurable)
- Force-directed layout algorithm
- Real-time updates from Neo4j database

### 2. Interactive Documentation

#### What It Includes
The Docs tab provides a comprehensive guide covering:

- **System Overview** - High-level architecture explanation
- **Retrieval Methods** - Details on BM25, Dense Retrieval, and Graph traversal
- **How to Use** - Step-by-step guide for each feature
- **Knowledge Graph Details** - In-depth explanation of the graph structure
- **Technical Specifications** - Technologies and features
- **Tips & Best Practices** - Usage recommendations

#### Sections

##### System Architecture
Explains how the three retrieval methods work together:
- **BM25**: Keyword-based search for exact matches

## Backend Enhancements

### New API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/graph/stats`
Returns statistics about the knowledge graph.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "documents": 5,
  "chunks": 43,
  "entities": 127,
  "relationships": 89
}
```

#### GET `/api/graph/visualization?limit=100`
Returns graph data for visualization.

**Parameters:**
- `limit` (optional): Maximum number of entities to return (default: 100)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "entity123",
      "name": "Machine Learning",
      "type": "CONCEPT",
      "language": "en",
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "entity123",
      "target": "entity456",
      "type": "RELATES_TO",
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "chunk_connections": [
    {
      "chunk_id": "doc1_chunk_0",
      "chunk_text": "Machine learning is...",
      "entity_id": "entity123",
      "confidence": 0.9
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "documents": 5,
    "chunks": 43,
    "entities": 127,
    "relationships": 89
  }
}
```

### Neo4j Client Methods

Two new methods added to `Neo4jClient`:

#### `get_graph_stats()`
Retrieves counts of all node and relationship types in the graph.

#### `get_graph_visualization_data(limit)`
Fetches entities, relationships, and chunk connections for visualization.

**Features:**
- Orders entities by confidence score
- Limits results for performance
- Includes chunk-entity connections
- Filters out invalid relationships

## Frontend Components

### GraphVisualization Component

**File:** `frontend/src/components/GraphVisualization.jsx`

**Features:**
- Canvas-based graph rendering
- Interactive node selection
- Hover effects
- Statistics dashboard
- Entity type legend
- Node detail panel
- Refresh functionality

**State Management:**
- `graphData`: Stores nodes, edges, and statistics
- `selectedNode`: Currently selected entity
- `hoveredNode`: Currently hovered entity
